# Hi there 👋 I'm Maddie

I'm a computational biologist studying host-microbe interactions in cancer. I love applying my background knowledge in experimental molecular biology to analze omics datasets and uncover new mechanisms that drive disease progression. I am also passionate about utilizing computational methods for discovering novel biomarkers for early disease detection. 

- 🔬 Computational postdoc at the Knight Cancer Instutite within OHSU 
- 🧬 Interested in microbiome analysis, single-cell data, multi-omics, and data integration
- 💻 R, Python, Linux, SLURM
- 🌱 Open to industry career opportunities!

## Other skills
Many of my projects are in progress, and I am not able to make the code public until a publication is released. I am happy to provide details of my experience in any of these areas upon request!

**Machine Learning**
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Project description</i> - I created a <b> Random Forest Classifier </b> using <b> scikit-lear </b> to integrate microbiome and patient lifestyle/diet information in order to determine drivers for cancer risk.

**Data cleaning & large data handling**
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Project description</i> - I wrote an automated and reproducible pipeline to clean a dataset containing hundreds of clinical features and written survey answers for downstream use in machine learning applications.

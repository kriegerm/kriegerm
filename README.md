# Hi there 👋 I'm Maddie

I'm a computational biologist studying host-microbe interactions. I utilize my deep understanding of the human microbiome to help design and validate smarter products to support human health. I also love applying knowledge I've gained through a background in experimental molecular biology to analze omics datasets and uncover new mechanisms that drive disease progression. 
<br>

I hold a Ph.D. in molecular microbiology, where I studied RNA regulation in prokaryotic pathogens. I completed my first postdoc in 2021 in the Merritt lab at the OHSU School of Dentistry, where I studied polymicrobial interactions in oral disease. I then finished a second postdoc at the Knight Cancer Institute within OHSU, where I worked as a Computational Biologist to integrate multi-omic datasets to better understand early drivers of cancer intituation and progression.

## ⭐️ Unpublished Projects
Many of my projects are in progress, and I am not able to make the code public until a publication is released. I am happy to provide details of my experience in any of these areas upon request!

**Machine Learning**<br>
<i>Project description</i> - I created a <b> Random Forest Classifier </b> using <b> scikit-learn </b> to integrate microbiome and patient lifestyle/diet information in order to determine drivers for cancer risk. <i>Publication coming Fall 2025!</i>

**Data cleaning & large data handling**<br>
<i>Project description</i> - I wrote an automated and reproducible pipeline to clean a dataset containing hundreds of clinical features and written survey answers for downstream use in machine learning applications. <i>Publication coming Spring </i>2026!

**Creating a novel pangenome for transcriptomic analysis**<br>
<i>Project description</i> - In order to directly compare transcriptomics data from two related bacterial strains, I first created a pangenome of overlapping genes using [Anvi'o](https://anvio.org/). Then, I used that pangenome to map RNA-seq reads from each bacteria in order to generate differential gene expression data for only shared features. <i>Publication coming Spring 2026!</i>
